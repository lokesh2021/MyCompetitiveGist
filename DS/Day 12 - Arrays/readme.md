 # **Accessing 2-D Arrays Elements** using 3 Methods mentioned below
 - ## 1) Using Normal 2D Array
 - ## 2) Using One Pointer and linking it to multiple Arrays (Combination of both Pointer and Array)
 - ## 3) Using only pointers

 # How address of element in Array is Obtained by the compiler?
 ## It can be obtained by the following formula

                A[n]=L0+n*T

    where, L0 = Starting address of the Array
           n = Element Index in Array
           T = DataType value of that Array

    example: A[4]=200+4*2 = 208 which is the Address of A[4]
