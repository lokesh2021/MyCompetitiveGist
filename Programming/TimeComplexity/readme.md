# Time Complexity Of A Computer Program
### Time complexity related questions might not be asked directly to you in the interview.
### However, all interview conversations have been known to end with :

* ### “Whats the time complexity of the solution ?”
* ### “Can you improve the time complexity of your solution ?”
### which is why its essential for us to understand the basics of time and space complexity.

## Worst Case ( big oh O )

## Avg Case ( θ- big theta )

## Best Case ( Ω -big omega)

# Types of notations
1. **O-notation:** It is used to denote asymptotic upper bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by O(g(n)). Pronounced as “big-oh of g of
n”. It also known as worst case time complexity as it denotes the upper bound in which algorithm terminates.

2. **Ω-notation:** It is used to denote asymptotic lower bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by Ω(g(n)). Pronounced as “big-omega of
g of n”. It also known as best case time complexity as it denotes the lower bound in which algorithm terminates.

3. **θ-notation:** It is used to denote the average time of a program.
